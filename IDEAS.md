# Disclaimer
Here are some of my developing ideas that I'd like to share. However, I kindly ask that you refrain from stealing them. If any of these ideas interest you and you have the time and resources to bring them to fruition, please feel free to reach out to me. As much as I would love to pursue all of my ideas, my time is limited, and I'm open to the possibility of collaborating with others to make them happen.

# Ideas
## Automically translate traewelling checkins in trams or busses in gpx
Automatically fetch all checkins on traewelling in trams and busses, get a route on brouter (there is something like an api) and write these points in a gpx file. Maybe a database (sqlite or something like that) that saves all lines that are already translated would be nice.

## Stellwerksim todo list
There is a api to stellwerksim so it would be possible to get information from stellwerksim (like information of trains or events like a train joining the interlocking): Events like a train is joining the interlocking or a train would like to depart are written on a todo list (terminal based) and you can tick them off.
