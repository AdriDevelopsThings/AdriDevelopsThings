A backend developer interested in trains currently studying computer engineering.

My (in my opinion) coolest projects are:
- [regenbogen-ice](https://regenbogen-ice.de): Find the german rainbow train.
- [strecken-info-bot](https://github.com/AdriDevelopsThings/strecken-info-bot): A telegram and mastodon bot to receive updates about current disruptions in the german railway network.
- [iceportal-rich-presence](https://github.com/AdriDevelopsThings/iceportal-rich-presence): Get data from the ice portal of an ice and display the information on discord.
- [mandelbrot](https://github.com/AdriDevelopsThings/mandelbrot): A webserver displaying the mandelbrot set with leaflet.
