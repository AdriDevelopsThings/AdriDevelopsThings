# Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm AdriDevelopsThings
_(also known as AdriDoesThings)_


A backend developer interested in trains and public transport in general currently studying computer engineering.

My (in my opinion) coolest projects are:
- [regenbogen-ice](https://regenbogen-ice.de): Find the german rainbow train.
- [strecken-info-bot](https://github.com/AdriDevelopsThings/strecken-info-bot): A telegram and mastodon bot to receive updates about current disruptions in the german railway network. (Works with the [strecken.info](https://strecken.info) api)
- [iceportal-rich-presence](https://github.com/AdriDevelopsThings/iceportal-rich-presence): Get data from the ice portal of an german ice train and display the information on discord.
- [mandelbrot](https://github.com/AdriDevelopsThings/mandelbrot): A webserver displaying the mandelbrot set with leaflet.
